# Classification Algorithm Testing

This project explores and compares several classic supervised learning algorithms using datasets such as Iris, MNIST, and PlantVillage.

The goal is to analyze the performance of each algorithm based on various metrics:  
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **Execution time**
- **Memory usage**
